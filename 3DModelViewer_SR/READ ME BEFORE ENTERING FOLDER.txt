Welcome to Steven Reynolds 3D Model Viewer.

*******************************************
If you would like to run the application first please go to

3DModelViewer_SR\3DModelViewer_SR\Release

and run the 3DModelViewer_SR

YOu will then be greeted with a console application and the model render screen.
Please click on the Console application and type the file names only in the Release folder.
First of all type test and press enter.

******************************************
Inputting your own Model

If you would like to see how your model runs in my model viewer then please make sure that 
Your model has been exported with triangulation and centred otherwise it will not run! (It will still display, you will be able to see parts of it)

******************************************

All the information that you require is on screen, and you are required to close down the application by pressing the Red X button and then relaunching it.
******************************************

All the source code is available for this project and is vieweable if you open up the SLN.

Enjoy
